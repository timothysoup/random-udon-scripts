# Random Udon Scripts

This is a collection of random Udon scripts that I've made for VRChat. These scripts are free to use and modify, but please credit me if you use them in your own projects (unless I specify otherwise in the file or it is AI generated).

I am not responsible for any issues that may arise from using these scripts. Use at your own risk.
